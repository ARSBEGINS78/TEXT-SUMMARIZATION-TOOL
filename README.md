##DESCRIPTION: I HAVE USED FIVE MODULES IN MY PYTHON FILE TO MAKE WHICH ARE NLTK,SUMY,SSL,SPACY AND TEXTRANK. I HAVE THOROUGHLY JOTTED DOWN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING(NLP).AUTOMATIC TEXT SUMMARIZATION IS A KEY TECHNIQUE IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) THAT USES ALGORITHMS TO REDUCE LARGE TEXTS WHILE PRESERVING ESSENTIAL INFORMATION. ALTHOUGH IT DOESN’T RECEIVE AS MUCH ATTENTION AS OTHER MACHINE LEARNING BREAKTHROUGHS, TEXT SUMMARIZATION TECHNOLOGY HAS SEEN CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS. BY EXTRACTING KEY CONCEPTS AND MAINTAINING THE ORIGINAL MEANING, THESE SYSTEMS CAN REVOLUTIONIZE INDUSTRIES SUCH AS BANKING, LAW, AND HEALTHCARE, ENABLING FASTER DECISION-MAKING AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL.
THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY TYPES OF TEXT SUMMARIZATION TECHNIQUES:
1.	EXTRACTIVE SUMMARIZATION
2.	ABSTRACTIVE SUMMARIZATION
##EXTRACTIVE SUMMARIZATION
EXTRACTIVE SUMMARIZATION ALGORITHMS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE SUMMARIES BY SELECTING AND COMBINING KEY PASSAGES FROM THE ORIGINAL TEXT. UNLIKE HUMAN SUMMARIZERS, THESE MODELS FOCUS ON EXTRACTING THE MOST IMPORTANT SENTENCES WITHOUT CREATING NEW CONTENT. THE GOAL IS TO PRESERVE THE MEANING OF THE ORIGINAL TEXT WHILE CONDENSING IT.
##ABSTRACTIVE SUMMARIZATION
ABSTRACTIVE SUMMARIZATION GENERATES ENTIRELY NEW SENTENCES TO CONVEY KEY IDEAS FROM THE ORIGINAL TEXT. UNLIKE EXTRACTIVE SUMMARIZATION, WHICH SELECTS AND REARRANGES SENTENCES FROM THE ORIGINAL CONTENT, ABSTRACTIVE METHODS REPHRASE INFORMATION IN A MORE CONCISE AND COHERENT MANNER, OFTEN USING NEW VOCABULARY THAT WASN’T PRESENT IN THE ORIGINAL.
I HAVE USED MANY WEBSITES CONTENT LIKE STACK OVERFLOW AND CHATGPT.
IN THE PROGRAM I HAVE USED NLTK WHICH IS **TOKENIZATION AND SENTENCE SEGMENTATION ARE FUNDAMENTAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) TECHNIQUES. THEY INVOLVE BREAKING DOWN TEXT INTO MEANINGFUL UNITS SUCH AS WORDS OR SENTENCES**.
AND SUMY WHICH IS **IT TRIES TO FIND THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SENTENCES IN THE DOCUMENT(S) AND COMPOSE IT INTO THE SHORTENED TEXT**
AND SSL WHICH **IS A SOFTWARE COMPONENT THAT PROVIDES FUNCTIONS AND CLASSES FOR SECURE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN A CLIENT AND SERVER.**
AND SPACY WHICH IS **A FREE, OPEN-SOURCE PYTHON LIBRARY THAT PROVIDES ADVANCED CAPABILITIES TO CONDUCT NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) ON LARGE VOLUMES OF TEXT AT HIGH SPEED.**
AND ALSO TEXTRANK WHICH IS**A GRAPH-BASED RANKING MODEL FOR TEXT PROCESSING WHICH CAN BE USED IN ORDER TO FIND THE MOST RELEVANT SENTENCES IN TEXT AND ALSO TO FIND KEYWORDS.**
SINCERELY I HAVE FOLLOWED ALL INSTRUCTIONS.
